# Azure Support Plans
 
Azure offers four different support plans, the most basic one being included for all Azure customers while the other three require additional payment. The scope of the support per plan and the cost is defined as such:

1. Basic: included for all Azure customers for free.
2. Developer: trial and non-production environments. Costs: $29 a month.
3. Standard: production workload environments. Costs: $100 a month.
4. Professional Direct: business-critical dependence. Costs: $1000 a month.

Support is provided in nine different languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Traditional Chinese, Korean, and Japanese. Support is billed on a monthly basis and is automatically renewed.
