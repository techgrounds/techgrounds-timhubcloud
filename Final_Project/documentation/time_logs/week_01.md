## Daily report
Wrote down questions for our scrum master to ask the product owners (meeting set at 14:00 tomorrow) and did a deep dive into the Microsoft Bicep learn modules.

## Obstacles
Had problems with laggy and failed deployment in my Azure Sandbox.

Another problem was with the Azure Sandbox code block examples requiring multiple lines but not knowing how to do this in Bash.

## Solutions
First problem fixed itself after about 30 minutes.

Second problem solution found on stackoverflow:

> So, you literally need a newline (press ENTER) after you type the \ to tell the shell you want to enter more parameters but on a separate line.

## Learnings
How to analyze a product owners' requirement and formulate questions; how to deploy resources using bicep, parameter file, modules etc.
